# C-Compiler
Writing a C compiler as an excuse to read the spec

## ToDo:
- [ ] array declarations
- [ ] labels, goto
- [ ] continue, break
- [ ] typedef
- [ ] switch
- [ ] sizeof

## fixes
- [ ] cleanup declaration
- [ ] unity build
- [ ] Actually scan preprocessing directives instead
- [ ] Write test for every possible type specifier (find it in declarations in the spec)
- [ ] empty block
